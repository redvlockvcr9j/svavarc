**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using any number of various Markdown editors. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing books, blogs and messages, or to simply create rich text using a plain text editor.

**Documents contained herein** are edited from scratch into Markdown format for import into other formats or into your own 5E projects. This is not a simple export as you find elsewhere, we have painstakingly remastered the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown paragraph-by-paragraph and **includes all errata from Nov 2018**. Please report any issues you find through this Github account.
