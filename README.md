#### Welcome to the online Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition System Reference Document v5.1 in Markdown Format!

---

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues.

The documents contained herein are edited from scratch into Markdown format for portability and conversion to other formats. This is not a basic conversion as you find elsewhere, we have painstakingly converted the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown paragraph-by-paragraph. Please report any issues you find through this GitHub account. Thank you!
