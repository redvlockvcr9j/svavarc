This is an adaptation of the D&D 5E SRD available in Markdown (.MD), Microsoft Word (.DOCX), Adobe InCopy/InDesign (.ICML) and many other publishing formats.

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) to compare the programs.

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using any number of various Markdown editors. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing books, blogs and messages, or to simply create rich text using a plain text or markkdown editor. 

The publishing documents contained herein were REmastered line-by-line into Markdown format then exported to the other publishing formats to be utilized in your own 5E projects. I have painstakingly converted the original Wizard's SRD v5.1 PDF to markdown, plus all errata from the _Nov 2018 update_.
