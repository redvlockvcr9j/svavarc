#### Welcome to the online Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition System Reference Document (SRD) v5.1 Remastered in Markdown Format!

---

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using any number of various Markdown editors. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing books, blogs and messages, or to simply create rich text using a plain text editor.

! The documents contained herein are edited from scratch into Markdown format for portability and conversion to other formats. This is not a basic conversion as you find elsewhere, we have painstakingly remastered the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown paragraph-by-paragraph. The original documents can be downloaded from our [Cry Havoc Studio GitHub repository](https://github.com/CryHavocStudio/OGL-SRD5). Please report any issues you find through our GitHub account. Thank you!

#### New Features
1. **Powerful search engines** for the D&D 5E SRD using our standard highlight search field (upper-left sidebar), or use the new _TNT Search_, an advanced full-text search feature (also upper-left sidebar), or perform a [custom Google search](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=001286843246981938841:_5jzoxwanvq) of the SRD.
2. **Public editing** and the correction of errors on pages now available directly through GitHub. Links can be found in the upper right-hand corner of each page. **NOTE:** A free GitHub account/membership is required. **WARNING:** Abuse of this wiki-like process shall not be tollerated resulting in the denial of public editing. Thank you for your cooperation and collaboration!
