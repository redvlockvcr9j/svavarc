#### Welcome to the online Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition System Reference Document (SRD) v5.1 Remastered in Markdown & Microsoft Word Formats!

---

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) to compare the programs.

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using any number of various Markdown editors. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing books, blogs and messages, or to simply create rich text using a plain text or markkdown editor.
! The documents contained herein are edited line-by-line into Markdown format for export to other formats or into your own 5E projects. Here have painstakingly remastered the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown, **plus all errata from the Nov 2018 update**. The original documents can be downloaded from my [Github OGL-SRD Repository](https://github.com/Umbyology/OGL-SRD5). Please report any issues you find through our Github account, or make any corrections through a Github pull request.
