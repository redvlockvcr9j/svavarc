#### Welcome to the online Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition System Reference Document v5.1 in Markdown Format!

---

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The [Dungeon Masters Guild](http://dungeonmastersguild.com/) also provides self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities. For an overview of the programs, please visit the official [Wizards SRD page](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net). It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.[8] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues.

! The documents contained herein are rewritten from scratch in Markdown format for portability and conversion to other formats. This is not a basic conversion as you find on other sites, we have painstakingly converted the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown paragraph-by-paragraph. The original documents can be downloaded from our [Sigillum-Rasa GitHub repository](https://github.com/sigillumrasa/OGL-SRD5). Please report any issues you find through our GitHub account. Thank you!
